takePicture()为CameraView.java三方库提供的接口

```java
/**
    * Asks the camera to capture an image of the current scene.
    * This will trigger {@link CameraListener#onPictureTaken(PictureResult)} if a listener
    * was registered.
    *
    * @see #takePictureSnapshot()
    */
public void takePicture() {
    PictureResult.Stub stub = new PictureResult.Stub();
    mCameraEngine.takePicture(stub);
}

```

2.根据PictureResult.Stub 调用

```java

    // Save boolean before scheduling! See how Camera2Engine calls this with a temp value.
    final boolean metering = mPictureMetering;
    getOrchestrator().scheduleStateful("take picture", CameraState.BIND,
            new Runnable() {
        @Override
        public void run() {
            LOG.i("takePicture:", "running. isTakingPicture:", isTakingPicture());
            if (isTakingPicture()) return;
            if (mMode == Mode.VIDEO) {
                throw new IllegalStateException("Can't take hq pictures while in VIDEO mode");
            }
            stub.isSnapshot = false;
            stub.location = mLocation;
            stub.facing = mFacing;
            stub.format = mPictureFormat;

/**
    * Triggers an asynchronous image capture. The camera service will initiate
    * a series of callbacks to the application as the image capture progresses.
    * The shutter callback occurs after the image is captured. This can be used
    * to trigger a sound to let the user know that image has been captured. The
    * raw callback occurs when the raw image data is available (NOTE: the data
    * will be null if there is no raw image callback buffer available or the
    * raw image callback buffer is not large enough to hold the raw image).
    * The postview callback occurs when a scaled, fully processed postview
    * image is available (NOTE: not all hardware supports this). The jpeg
    * callback occurs when the compressed image is available. If the
    * application does not need a particular callback, a null can be passed
    * instead of a callback method.
    *
    * <p>This method is only valid when preview is active (after
    * {@link #startPreview()}).  Preview will be stopped after the image is
    * taken; callers must call {@link #startPreview()} again if they want to
    * re-start preview or take more pictures. This should not be called between
    * {@link android.media.MediaRecorder#start()} and
    * {@link android.media.MediaRecorder#stop()}.
    *
    * <p>After calling this method, you must not call {@link #startPreview()}
    * or take another picture until the JPEG callback has returned.
    *
    * @param shutter   the callback for image capture moment, or null
    * @param raw       the callback for raw (uncompressed) image data, or null
    * @param postview  callback with postview image data, may be null
    * @param jpeg      the callback for JPEG image data, or null
    * @throws RuntimeException if starting picture capture fails; usually this
    *    would be because of a hardware or other low-level error, or because
    *    release() has been called on this Camera instance.
